# Spectrum
Spectrum is a first-order logic theorem prover that implements SIG-Res, an inference system that couples together SInst-Gen and ordered resolution into a single inference system.  In SIG-Res, given a set F of first order clauses we create two sets, P and R, each a subset of F. Under SIG-Res, P is saturated by SInst-Gen and resolution is applied to pairs of clauses in P ∪ R where at least one of the clauses is in R.
